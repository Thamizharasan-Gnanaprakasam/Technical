Data Sampling
	> The use case of Data Sampling is for Data Analysis on a randam sample data istead of quyerying the big table
	> Effective on compue cost

Methods:
	> Row or Bernoulli
		- Probablity of choosing each row with percentage p
		- more Randomness
		- More useful while getting sample data from smaller table

	> Block or System  
		- Probablity of chossing each block (micropartition) with percentage p
		- More effective processing
		- More useful while getting sample data from lagre table
